# Python Instacart Case Study
#### You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. 
#### Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.

# Objective
#### Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest 
#### strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 

# Key Questions:
#### ● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are 
#### (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
#### ● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, 
#### as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
#### ● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range 
#### groupings to help direct their efforts.
#### ● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know 
#### which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
#### ● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and 
####   how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
####   1-  What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?</li></ul>
####   2-  Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?</li>
####   3-  Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?</li>
####   4-  Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?</li>
####   5-  What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?</li>
####   6-  What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, 
####      the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Data
#### Instacart is a real company that has made their data available online. However, the data sets provided in this project brief were fabricated 
#### for this project and provided by Career Foundry. The data provided contained these data sets:
#### ● Customers Data Set
#### ● Departments Data Set
#### ● Orders Data Set
#### ● Orders_Products Data Set
#### ● Products Data Set

# Tools
#### The following Python libraries were used in this project:

#### Pandas: for data analization
#### Seaborn: for data visualization

#### Numpy: for mathematical equations

# Folders
#### The project files are divided between the following folders:

#### Project Management: Project Brief
#### Data (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
#### Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
#### Analysis: The visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
#### Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
